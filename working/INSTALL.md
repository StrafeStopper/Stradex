Follow the instructions below to install dependencies and run the engine 


1. Installing dependencies:
    * Linux:
      * run `install.sh` to install the needed dependencies

    * Windows:
      * run `install.sh` to install the needed dependencies

2. Running the engine:
    * Linux:
      * run `./light`

    * Windows:
      * run `wine light.exe` in linux

It runs with wine in Linux but doesn't run in Windows quite yet. A fix for this is planned but not currently being worked on.
