Follow the instructions below to install dependencies, compile, and run the engine

The engine can only be developed and compiled in Linux

1. Installing dependencies:
    * Linux:
      * run `install.sh` to install the needed dependencies

    * Windows:
      * run `[update with install script]` to install the needed dependencies
      * will have an install script eventually

2. Compiling:
    * Linux:
      * run `make linux` to compile

    * Windows
      * run `compile.bat` to compile
      * make will work in the future

3. Running the engine:
    * Linux:
      * run `./light`

    * Windows:
      * run `wine light.exe` in linux
      * double click on `stradex.exe` in windows

The Linux executable runs in Linux only, using an emulator on Windows has not been tested.

The Windows executable runs natively in Windows with the most up-to-date DLL's.
