# Install

This engine has no install client

Run `install.sh` to install the needed dependencies to compile and run the program

To compile in Linux run `make linux` and use `./light` to run the engine

To compile in Windows run `make windows` and use `wine light.exe`

It runs with wine in Linux but doesn't run in Windows quite yet
