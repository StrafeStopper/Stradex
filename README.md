# Stradex
## Game enigine designed in C++ with SDL2 codenamed "STRADEX"

* The folders are as follows:
  * /dev is the current development branch. It contains the most updated code and has all of the development libraries. It is not guaranteed to work properly or even run at all as it is being actively worked on. It is ready to compile and run after `install.sh` has been run.
  * /working is the branch with the most recent fixes. It should run but is still not guaranteed. It is compiled and ready to run after `install.sh` has been ran for dependencies. It has no source and cannot be compiled.

Refer to `INSTALL.md` in the branch you want to run

This project is open source right now but will not be once alpha is released

It is important to note that nothing (including install scripts) are expected to work correctly.
