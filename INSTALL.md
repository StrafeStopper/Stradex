# Install

This engine has no install client

Run `install.sh` to install the needed dependencies to compile the program

If the script doesn't automatically compile the program then refer to the next line

To compile run `make all` and use `./light` to run the engine

This engine `currently` doesn't compile or run on windows, a cross compile is in the works
